The program should take two arguments on the command line:
 respectively the name of an input file and the name of an output
 file.
Each line of the input file is a description of a tennis match
 between two players named 'A' and 'B', and comprises a sequence
 of 'A's and 'B's which indicates the winner of each point in the
 match in the order that they are played.
For each line in the input, the program should write a line to
 the output in the format:
  [completed set scores] [score in current set] [score in current game]
